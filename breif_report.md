### Brief Report

#### Model Performance Summary
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved a perfect accuracy of 100% on the test set, successfully classifying all test samples without any errors. The classification report highlights that the precision, recall, and F1-scores for each of the three Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) are all flawless, demonstrating that the model made no mistakes in its predictions.

This is further confirmed by the confusion matrix, where all predicted values align perfectly with the actual values, indicating zero misclassifications.

#### How the Model Made Predictions
The SVM model in this assignment operates by finding the optimal hyperplane that best distinguishes between different classes in the feature space. For this dataset, the model successfully separated the Iris species based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

When a sample data point was provided to the model (e.g., a flower with features `[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]`), the SVM classified it as "Setosa" by determining on which side of the decision boundary the data point fell. The modelâ€™s ability to accurately predict the class of this unseen data point reflects its strong generalization capability, built from its training on the dataset.
