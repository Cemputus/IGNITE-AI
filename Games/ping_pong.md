### 1. **Game Window Setup:**
   - When the game starts, a window is created using the `Tkinter` library. This window contains a **black background** where all game elements (ball and paddles) are displayed.
   
### 2. **Paddles:**
   - There are two paddles: 
     - **Left paddle (blue)** controlled by player 1 using the `W` and `S` keys (to move up and down).
     - **Right paddle (red)** controlled by player 2 using the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys.
   - The paddles move vertically, limited to the game window height.

### 3. **Ball Movement:**
   - A white ball starts in the middle of the window and moves in a diagonal direction. 
   - The ball **bounces off the top and bottom walls** of the window.
   - When the ball collides with a paddle, it changes direction, effectively bouncing back.
   
### 4. **Collision Detection:**
   - The game detects if the ball has touched a paddle:
     - For the left paddle, it checks if the ball is near the left side and within the vertical position of the paddle.
     - For the right paddle, it checks similarly for the right side.
   - If the ball misses a paddle (i.e., goes past the left or right edge of the window), it can be programmed to reset, score, or end the game.

### 5. **Player Controls:**
   - **Player 1 (left paddle)** presses `W` to move the paddle up and `S` to move it down.
   - **Player 2 (right paddle)** presses the **Up arrow** to move up and the **Down arrow** to move down.

### 6. **Scoring System (Optional):**
   - You can add a scoring system where if the ball passes either paddle, the opponent scores a point. The score would be displayed on the screen, and the ball would reset to the center.

### 7. **Game Flow:**
   - The ball keeps moving indefinitely until it either hits a paddle (bounces back) or passes a paddle (indicating a point).
   - The paddles can move up and down to try and hit the ball.
   - The game can end either after a set score is reached or when a player misses too many times.

### How to Play:
1. Run the game script.
2. Control the paddles using the keyboard (Player 1: W/S, Player 2: Up/Down arrows).
3. Try to prevent the ball from passing your paddle. The ball will bounce back if it hits a paddle or wall.
4. Optional: Track points or just play for fun!
